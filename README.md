# ðŸ§­ DIGITAL COMPASS
```This project to be one of the requirements for the Physical Cyber System Practicum class completion in Department of Computer Engineering,  University of Indonesia```

## About the project
---
The digital compass is made with assembly language in AVR using an MPU-9250 sensor and displaying the coordinate results at the form of tesla units onto an OLED display. This program is designed by Group A3 which consists of : 

- Zaki Ananda - 2106705474
- Zulfikar Hadzalic - 2106636224
- Muhammad Suhaili - 2106731535
- Aliefya Fikri Ihsani - 2106733843

## Introduction to the problem and the solution
---
Digital compasses have become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to the convenience and accuracy they offer over traditional compasses. However, as with any technology, there are potential problems and challenges associated with their use.

One of the problems with digital compasses is their reliance on battery power, which can run out at inconvenient times, leaving users without a reliable navigation tool. Another issue is the potential for interference from electronic devices, which can disrupt the compass's accuracy and make it difficult to obtain accurate readings.

Moreover, digital compasses require users to be familiar with their features and settings to use them properly. Many users may not fully understand the capabilities and limitations of their digital compasses, which can lead to inaccurate navigation and potentially dangerous situations.

## Hardware design and implementation details
---
In this project, we're trying to make our own digital compass using an MPU-9250 sensor which has its own utility including a gyroscope module that could read our current position's relative orientation. Furthermore, we would display those plane coordinates which the sensor read onto an OLED display. The equipments we use are:

- MPU-9250 sensor module
- Arduino Uno
- Jumper Cable
- OLED Display
- Breadboard

From top to bottom, the OLED screen will display these three types of angular rate measurements in the form of tesla units :
- Yaw : the horizontal rotation on a flat surface when seen the object from above.
- Pitch : vertical rotation as seen the object from front.
- Roll : horizontal rotation when seen the object from front.
